As the need for pipeline security and automation grows, so does the demand for educational and 
practice materials in these areas. While there may be resources available for specific tools, 
there will always be a need for materials or platforms that allow for practice in real-world scenarios. 

Also having the pipeline available both for use on a local setup such as a kali linux machine and 
having it available on haaukins will make the material for educational purposes more accessible.
